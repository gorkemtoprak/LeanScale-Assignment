# Lean Scale Assignment

Food delivery application assignment. The application has different foods, categories and restaurants. Features are as follows; 
 - Stacked as a state management
 - Hive for caching
 - Autoroute for routing
 - ConnectivityPlus for managing the network 
 - HTTP for request and response process
 - Foods and Restaurants can be marked as favourite/unfavourite
 - Have a checkout screen
 - Foods images from URL

| Pros | Cons  |
| :-----: | :-: | 
| Beautiful User Interfaces | Unfortunately restaurants were given statically because I couldn't find any public APIs| 
| Unit Test Done | Profile screen could have been improved|
